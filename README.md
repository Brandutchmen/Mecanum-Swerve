# Mecanum-Swerve
A very sketch drive idea that no team should recreate

### Concept:
* Two front wheels as Meccanum
* Two rear wheels as swerve

## Can it drive?
Answer: Yes, but it isn't super fast or powerful. This is only useful for off-season bots. It doesn't offer any promising potential in the realms of competition.
